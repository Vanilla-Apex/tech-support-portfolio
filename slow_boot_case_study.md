# 🖥️ Case Study: Diagnosing Slow Boot on an Older PC

**Client:** Friend using a 2012 desktop PC  
**Problem:** System had extremely slow startup and delayed app loading after boot  
**Symptoms:**  
- Boot time over 4 minutes  
- Black screen for ~30 seconds post-login  
- High disk usage in Task Manager

## 🔧 Steps Taken

1. Opened Task Manager and identified high-impact startup programs (e.g. Skype, OneDrive, auto-updaters).
2. Disabled unnecessary startup programs.
3. Checked disk health using CrystalDiskInfo—no major issues, but HDD was at 90% capacity.
4. Ran Disk Cleanup to remove temp files and system junk.
5. Defragmented the HDD using built-in Windows tool.
6. Rebooted and timed post-clean performance.
