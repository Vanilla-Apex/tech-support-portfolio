# 🛠️ IT Case Studies – Tom Burris

Welcome! I’m Tom Burris, a certified IT support specialist based in Chiba, Japan.  
These case studies showcase real-world troubleshooting scenarios where I applied CompTIA A+ and Network+ principles to solve hardware, software, and network problems.

I created this portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on technical abilities, communication skills, and client-focused mindset in tech support environments.
