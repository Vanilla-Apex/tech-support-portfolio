# 🧾 Documentation Guide: Explaining Network Troubleshooting to Non-Technical Users

## 🎯 Purpose

To provide a simple, non-technical explanation of basic network troubleshooting steps—helping users understand what they can try before escalating the issue to technical support.

## 👥 Audience

- Home users
- Colleagues in non-IT departments
- ESL (English as a Second Language) learners

## 📋 Step-by-Step: How I Explain It

### 1️⃣ “Check the Basics First”

I ask them to:
- Make sure the Wi-Fi is turned on
- Confirm other devices are also having the issue
- Restart the device and router (the golden rule!)

🗣️ I explain:  
> “Sometimes the device just needs a fresh start. Like giving it a little nap.”

---

### 2️⃣ “Look at the Lights”

I guide them to:
- Look at the modem/router lights
- Identify if the 'Internet' or 'WAN' light is off or flashing red

🗣️ I explain:  
> “Green lights are good. Red or blinking lights usually mean something’s wrong with the internet connection.”

---

### 3️⃣ “Try a Wired Connection (if possible)”

- Suggest plugging in with an Ethernet cable to test  
- If it works wired but not wireless—it's likely a Wi-Fi issue

🗣️ I explain:  
> “This is like testing a car battery directly—helps narrow down the problem.”

---

### 4️⃣ “Still Not Working? Call Support with Notes Ready”

- Encourage them to write down:
  - What happened
  - What they’ve tried
  - Any error messages or odd lights

🗣️ I explain:  
> “Support will help you faster if you’ve already done the basics.”
