# 🧪 Experiment Log: Testing Bootable Linux USB Tools (Kali + Ubuntu)

## 🎯 Purpose

To compare the performance and usability of two bootable Linux distributions—Kali Linux and Ubuntu—using live USBs on the same machine.

---

## 🛠️ Test Setup

- **PC:** Lenovo ThinkPad with 8GB RAM
- **USB Tool Used:** balenaEtcher for flashing ISO files
- **Distros Tested:**
  - Kali Linux (Latest release)
  - Ubuntu Desktop (Latest LTS release)
- **Boot Mode:** Live boot (non-persistent)

---

## 🧪 Process

1️⃣ Downloaded official ISO files from Kali and Ubuntu  
2️⃣ Used balenaEtcher to flash each ISO to separate USB drives  
3️⃣ Booted each distro from BIOS boot menu  
4️⃣ Timed boot process from power-on to usable desktop  
5️⃣ Tested:
- Wi-Fi recognition
- Interface responsiveness
- Terminal access
- Pre-installed tools and apps

## 📊 Results

| Feature              | Kali Linux        | Ubuntu Desktop     |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Boot Time (approx)   | 55 seconds        | 35 seconds          |
| Ease of Use          | Technical users   | Beginner-friendly   |
| Wi-Fi Configuration  | Manual            | Automatic           |
| Pre-installed Tools  | Pentesting tools  | Productivity apps   |
