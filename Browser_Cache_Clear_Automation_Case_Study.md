# üßπ Automating Browser Cache Clear with Task Scheduler + Script

---

## üß© Scenario  
In shared environments like classrooms or multi-user PCs, browsers can quickly accumulate cache and temp data, leading to sluggish performance or profile glitches. Rather than relying on users to manually clear this, I automated the cleanup process using Task Scheduler and scripting.

---

## üîç Problem  
Users were experiencing slow browser performance, occasional website loading issues, and login conflicts ‚Äî all tied to leftover cache and cookies. Manual clearing was inconsistent and not scalable in a shared device setting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

1. **Designed a cleanup script**  
    - Created a batch file and PowerShell script combo to silently delete browser cache for Chrome and Edge.

2. **Identified browser cache paths**  
    - Chrome: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`  
    - Edge: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cache`

3. **Used PowerShell to remove contents**  
    ```powershell
    Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache\*" -Force -Recurse
    Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cache\*" -Force -Recurse
    ```

4. **Wrapped the cleanup in a `.bat` script**  
    - This allowed it to be triggered by Task Scheduler.

5. **Created a Task Scheduler job**  
    - Trigger: ‚ÄúAt log on‚Äù for all users  
    - Action: Run the `.bat` script  
    - Settings: Run with highest privileges, hidden window

6. **Tested across multiple profiles**  
    - Verified successful silent cleanup post-login without user intervention

## ‚úÖ Result  
Browser performance improved, and users no longer experienced the same sluggishness or login issues. Automation ensures consistency and reduces support requests.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used  
- PowerShell  
- Batch scripting  
- Task Scheduler (Windows)  
- Local file system permissions

---

## üß† What I Learned  
- Task Scheduler is a powerful but underused tool in desktop support  
- A combination of scripting and automation can reduce long-term support friction  
- Understanding file paths and permissions is key when working across user accounts
